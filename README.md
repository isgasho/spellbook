### Summary

Here you will find a "spellbook" with my personal scripts, exploits and other small things I wrote during my bug hunts, pentesting or red teaming missions. Like any other spellbook, some things here are not going to be very easy to understand, but like any other spellbook it couldn't be different, right?

The main focus of this "micro-framework" is to keep my personal scripts organized and make them available in a structure where I can reuse the code that has already been written to write something else. Furthermore, the Spellbook is just a research project that so far is no big deal and does not replace a truly robust framework.

### How to create new modules

First, you need to specify your module in the list of packages that Spellbook reads, present in: **.config/modules.json**

![](https://heitorgouvea.me/images/projects/spellbook/example_packages-json.png)

Just copy the last block of the json and insert the information of the new module;

Second, all modules are stored and accessible through the lib/Modules folder, each module is organized in a third folder that defines its category, such as:

![](https://heitorgouvea.me/images/projects/spellbook/list-modules.png)

Find the folder for the specific category of your module, or create one, then you can create your module normally like any other Perl module.

The only premise is that your module receives a main entry point and returns the results in an array.
